## Setting up your working area

If you completed the [Docker pre-exercises](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop2022-lesson-docker/) 
you should already have worked through 
[this episode](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop2022-lesson-docker/03-docker-for-cms-opendata/index.html), under **Download the docker images for ROOT and python tools and start container**, and you will have

- a working directory `cms_open_data_root` on your local computer
- a docker container with name `my_root` created with the working directory `cms_open_data_root` mounted into the `/code` directory of the container.

Start your ROOT container with

~~~
docker start -i my_root
~~~
{: .language-bash}

In the container, you will be in the `/code` directory and it shares the files with your local `cms_open_data_root` directory.


## Your first C/C++ program

Let's start with writing a simple `hello world` program in C. First we'll edit the
*source* code with an editor of your choice. 

Note that you will
*edit* the file in a local terminal on your computer and then *run* the file 
in the Docker environment. This is because we mounted the `cms_open_data_root` directory
on your local disk such that it is visible inside the Docker container.

Let's create a new file called `hello_world.cc` in the `cms_open_data_root` directory, using your preferred editor. 

The first thing we need to do, is `include` some standard libraries. These libraries
allow us to access the C and C++ commands to print to the screen (`stdout` and `stderr`) as
well as other basic function.

At the very beginning of your file, add these three lines

~~~
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

The first library, `cstdlib`, you will see in almost every C++ program as it has many of the very
basic functions, including those to allocate and free up memory, or even just exit the program.

The second library, `cstdio`, contains the basic C functions to print to screen, like `printf`.

The third library, `iostream`, contains C++ functions to print to screen or write to files.

Usually people will use one or the other of the C or C++ printing functions, but for pedagogical purposes,
we show you both.

Every C++ program must have a `main` function. So let's define it here. The scope of this function
is defined by curly brackets `{ }`. So let's add

~~~
int main() {


    return 0;
}
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

The `int` at the beginning tells us that this function will be returning an integer value. At the end of
the `main` function we have `return 0`, which usually means the function has run successfully to completion.

> ## Warning!
> Note that at the end of `return 0`, we have a semicolon `;`, which is how C/C++ programs terminate lines.
> If you're used to programming in python or any other language that does not use a similar terminator, this
> can be tough to remember. If you get errors when you compile, check the error statements for the lack
> of `;` in any of your lines!
>
{: .callout}

For this function, we are not passing in any arguments so we just have the empty `( )` after the `main`.

This function would compile, but it doesn't do anything. Let's print some text to screen. Before
the `return 0;` line, let's add these three lines.

~~~
    printf("Hello world! This uses the ANSI C 'printf' statement\n");

    std::cout << "Hello world! This uses the C++ 'iostream' library to direct output to standard out." << std::endl;

    std::cerr << "Hello world! This uses the C++ 'iostream' library to direct output to standard error." << std::endl;
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

The text itself, should explain what they are doing. If you want to learn more about standard error and standard
output, you can read more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams).

OK! Your full `hello_world.cc` should look like this.

> ## Full source code file for `hello_world.cc`
> ~~~
> #include <cstdlib>
> #include <cstdio>
> #include <iostream>
>
>
> int main() {
>
>     printf("Hello world! This uses the ANSI C 'printf' statement\n");
>
>     std::cout << "Hello world! This uses the C++ 'iostream' library to direct output to standard out." << std::endl;
>
>     std::cerr << "Hello world! This uses the C++ 'iostream' library to direct output to standard error." << std::endl;
>
>     return 0;
>
> }
> ~~~
> {: .language-cpp}
{: .solution}

This won't do anything yet though! We need to *compile* the code, which means turning this into
[*machine code*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code). To do this, we'll use the GNU C++ compiler, `g++`.
Once you have saved your file, go to the container shell, make sure (e.g. with `ls -l`) that you your file is in the current directory and type this in your shell.

~~~
g++ hello_world.cc -o hello_world

~~~
{: .language-bash}

This compiles your code to an executable called `hello_world`. You can now run this by typing the following on
the shell command line, after which you'll see the subsequent output.

~~~
./hello_world
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
Hello world! This uses the ANSI C 'printf' statement
Hello world! This uses the C++ 'iostream' library to direct output to standard out.
Hello world! This uses the C++ 'iostream' library to direct output to standard error.
~~~
{: .output}

When you are working with the Open Data, you will be looping over events
and may find yourself making selections based on certain physics criteria.
To that end, you may want to familiarize yourself with the C++ syntax for
[loops](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_for_loop.asp)
and
[conditionals](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_conditions.asp).
